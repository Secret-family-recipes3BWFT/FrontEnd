# FrontEnd

In this app, one can register with username and login to create an account, and then they are automatically logged in to the app, where they can create and store recipes, with the intent of preserving family food traditions - Traditionize is the name of the app.

I, Gregory, used styled-components library to style the app.

NPM dependencies in this react app include yup - for form validation, styled-components - for styling, react-router-dom for the different routes/pages of the app, and axios to make the post and get requests to the API.  You can install these dependencies by typing:

npm i yup styled-components react-router-dom axios
